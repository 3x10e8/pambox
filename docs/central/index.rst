Central auditory processing
===========================


The :mod:`~pambox.central` regroups what is *not* considered to be part of
the outer, middle, or inner ear. It's a rather broad concept.

It contains:

   - An implementation of the EPSM modulation filterbank
     (:func:`~pambox.central.EPSMModulationFilterbank`)
   - An Ideal Observer (:class:`~pambox.central.IdealObs`), as used in the
     :class:`~pambox.speech.Sepsm` model.
